      <h1>CIS 127: HTML5 and CSS3</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my CIS 127 home page. This page will be the entry point for 
      all the pages we create during the semester.</p>
      <p>Our pages will be static HTML pages, but they could just as easily be delivered 
      by a web framework such as Rails, Django, or PHP. 
      </p>
      <h3>Assets</h3>
      <p>
      Assets include things like CSS files, images, Javascript, multimedia files. Some modern web frameworks (I'm speaking of Rails) create an asset pipeline that concatenates multiple files (CSS and Javascript) into a single minified file. The idea is to reduced the number of requests made on the server. 
      </p>
      <p>I suggest that you create an <strong>assets</strong> sub-directory inside of your <code>cis127</code> directory. Use the <code>assets</code> directory to organze your site's future assets.
      </p>
      <h3>Validation</h3>
      <p>By the way, your page should validate if possible. Your HTML5 code may work, even be technically
      correct, yet show errors. Opera can validate your HTML. Right click the page and click validate.</p>
